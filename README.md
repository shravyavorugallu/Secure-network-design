# Secure Network Design

This project consists of two tasks that focus on network security. The first task is about designing a secure network diagram that represents a secure network environment, while the second task involves writing a concise article about a recent security event. Both tasks aim to improve your understanding of network security, help you visualize security implementations, and enhance your communication skills for a broad audience.

## Task 1: Secure Network Diagram

### Objective:
- Gain proficiency in visualizing the flow of network information.
- Understand the role of network devices and their contributions to securing the network.
- Demonstrate defense-in-depth techniques.

### Scenario:
As a Network Security Engineer at a small or mid-sized company, you have been tasked with improving the companyâ€™s network security. The company has acknowledged that security was previously deprioritized, and now it is your responsibility to implement solutions that will protect the company's network. To start, you need to understand the network and design a secure network that will help achieve the desired security posture.

### Deliverable:
a **secure network diagram** that includes the following:

- **Network Devices**: Include all the devices used in the network (e.g., routers, firewalls, switches, access points, etc.).
- **Information Flow**: Illustrate how data moves through the network, ensuring you highlight secure paths and secure configurations.
- **Security Configurations**: Notate any secure configurations you've implemented, such as:
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access.
  - VPNs for secure remote connections.
  - Firewalls for controlling traffic.
  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for monitoring network activity.
  - Segmentation of the network to separate sensitive data.
  - Any other security technologies or best practices.

### Key Points to Consider:
- **Defense-in-depth**: Diagram demonstrates multiple layers of security, where each layer adds an additional barrier against potential attacks.

### Tools:
- You can use any diagramming tool (e.g., Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, draw.io) to create your secure network diagram.

## Task 2: Recent Security Event Article

### Objective:
- A short, concise, and thoughtful article on a recent security event.
- Communicating the significance of the event to a general technical audience.


### Key Points Addressed:
1. **Summary of the Security Event**: Provided a clear and concise summary of the event, including the nature of the breach or attack.
2. **Root Cause**: Discussed the underlying factors that led to the security event. This could include technical vulnerabilities, human error, or organizational shortcomings.
3. **Preventative Measures**: Reflected on what could have been done differently to prevent the event. Consider early detection, better security practices, or more robust systems.
4. **Broader Issues**: Explored the ethical and societal implications of the event. For example, how did it affect users, and what are the consequences for privacy and trust?
5. **Potential Responses**: Proposed actions that could help mitigate the event, such as policy changes, corporate responsibility, or public awareness campaigns.


## Deliverables:

1. **Secure Network Diagram**: A diagram that visualizes the network, its devices, and secure configurations.
2. **Recent Security Event Article**: A well-written article that discusses a recent security event, its causes, and potential responses.
